# Detection-of-Face-Swap-based-Deep-Fake-Videos

## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting **face-swap-based deepfake videos** using deep learning techniques. The model leverages **ResNext** for feature extraction and **LSTM** for temporal pattern analysis to distinguish between real and fake videos.

## Features
- üé• **Upload and analyze videos easily**  
- üìä **Confidence scores with frame-by-frame analysis**  
- üß† **AI-powered deepfake detection using CNN & RNN models**  
- üîç **Real-time feedback and insights**  

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- Streamlit  

### Setup

#### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection

#### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py 

## Usage
1. Upload a video file in the application.
2. Click the Analyze Video button to start detection.
3. View the detection results, including confidence scores and analysis graphs.
4. Model Details
5. ResNext: Extracts features from video frames.
6. LSTM: Analyzes temporal patterns to distinguish real vs. fake videos.
7. Data Augmentation: Used to improve model generalization.
